                <p>
                    The Republic of Zambia was formed in 1964 after gaining independence from the British Empire.

                <p>
                    Zambia was rich in minerals such as copper and their economy was dependent on the export of copper. Hence when the price of copper suddenly declined in the 1970s, Zambia had less income and their debt shot up. Even in the 1990s, Zambia's debt was among the highest in the world.
