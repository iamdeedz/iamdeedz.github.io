                <p>
                    In 1952, Alan was convicted of having relationships with other men. He was forced to have treatment for this which ended up depressing him. In 1954, he was found dead in his house in Wilmslow, just south of Manchester. His death was determined as either accidental or intentional cyanide poisoning.
