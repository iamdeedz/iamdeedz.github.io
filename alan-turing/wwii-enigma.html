                    When WWII broke out, Alan Turing was recruited into Bletchley Park, a top-secret codebreaking facility in Milton Keyes, south of Northampton. While here he helped develop the some of the earliest versions of computers, the Bombe and the more advanced Colossus.

                <p>
                    During WWII, the Germans used a complex encryption machine called the Enigma machine to send messages. These messages were often intercepted by the British, however, they were unable to decode these messages. With the help of the Bombe and Colossus, Turing and his colleagues managed to crack the Enigma code.
